# CrackMeNot 🔐

CrackMeNot is a sleek, hacker-themed password strength checker built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It analyzes password strength in real-time, provides suggestions, and even estimates crack time using entropy-based calculations.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time password strength analysis
- Strength visualization with animated pie chart
- Entropy-based crack time estimation
- Wordlist comparison using `rockyou.txt`
- Suggestions for stronger passwords
- Toggle password visibility
- Clean and neon-glow hacker UI

## 🧠 How It Works

The strength score is calculated based on:
- Length of the password
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Common password avoidance (using a wordlist)
- Detection of patterns like repeated characters or keyboard sequences

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo or download the HTML file.
2. Make sure `rockyou.txt` is available in the same directory (optional but improves accuracy).
3. Open `index.html` (or rename the provided file) in your browser.
4. Type a password and get real-time feedback!
